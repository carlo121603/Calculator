This code represents a simple web-based calculator built using PHP, allowing users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Below is an overview of how the code functions:

Key Features:
User Input:

Two input fields (numOne and numTwo) allow users to enter decimal numbers.
A dropdown menu (operator) provides options for selecting arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
Two buttons:
"Calculate" to perform the calculation.
"Clear" to reset the result to zero.
Form Handling with PHP:

The form submission is processed via $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"], ensuring that the same page handles the input data.
PHP checks whether the form was submitted using the POST method.
The "Clear" button resets the result to 0.
Input Validation & Sanitization:

Inputs are sanitized using filter_input() to allow decimal and scientific notation.
Basic validation is performed to ensure:
Both fields are filled with numeric values.
Division by zero is prevented with an appropriate error message.
Calculation Logic:

A switch-case statement processes the selected arithmetic operation:
Addition: Adds the two numbers.
Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiplication: Multiplies the numbers.
Division: Divides the first number by the second (with division by zero prevention).
The result is displayed dynamically below the form.
Error Handling:

Displays error messages if:
Any field is left empty.
Non-numeric values are entered.
Division by zero is attempted.
If no errors are encountered, the calculated result is shown.
